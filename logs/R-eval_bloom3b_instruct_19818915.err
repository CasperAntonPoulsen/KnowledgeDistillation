Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action "sounds like the last breath before you\'re thrown out of the pub". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would "have a leg to stand on" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump\'s comments during last week\'s trade visit that the NHS would be "on the table" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was "absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation." The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump\'s remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly\'s Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said "legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don\'t have a veto over trade". "Politically, I think it\'s extremely unlikely to happen," the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. "They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power." Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or \'concordat\' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: "I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. "The argument we\'ll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it\'s not the reality of intergovernmental relations." "The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. "At the moment, your answers aren\'t giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government\'s argument is, \'we\'ll see you in court\', it\'s not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together," he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: "Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? "Absolutely not... and it\'s not just in relation to trade, it\'s in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built."\n Output: NHS Wales: Court action if trade deals affect service?\n\nNow complete the following example -\nInput: Chorley Council has objected to plans for the Cuerden retail park near Bamber Bridge in Lancashire amid concerns it could threaten its £17m town centre redevelopment. The authority is seeking the compensation from the developers and backers Lancashire County Council about the planned 65-hectare retail park. They said the "money is not justified". The developers said the site features restaurants and a hotel and would also create 4,500 jobs and could house offices and shops, as well as the Ikea store. But Chorley Council is concerned the plans could drive people away from its own new-look town centre, which will feature a cinema and new high street shops. The planning application will be dealt with by South Ribble Borough Council next month. Chorley Council has written a letter spelling out concerns, including fears about the impact of increased traffic. The council\'s deputy leader Peter Wilson said the council had been watching the plans "very closely" and wanted to "protect the interests" of Chorley. He added: "While we want to see economic growth across Lancashire, we are concerned that the proposals don\'t properly address the impact that a development of that size could have on Chorley town centre and the traffic and highways surrounding the area. "For those reasons, we cannot support the proposals as they currently stand." The council\'s objection letter demands "a financial contribution of £11,520,121.00 to mitigate the impact of the Cuerden development". A spokesman for the Cuerden Strategic Site developers said: "We are aware that Chorley Council has objected to the Cuerden application, however it is unclear from their letter what the justification is for doing so. "Following a detailed and robust assessment, our own professional advisers have concluded that the potential retail impacts on neighbouring areas are acceptable. "Therefore, Chorley Council\'s request for a significant sum of money by way of mitigation is not justified."\nOutput:', 'temperature': 1, 'max_tokens': 128}
