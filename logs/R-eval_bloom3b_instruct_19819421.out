Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action "sounds like the last breath before you\'re thrown out of the pub". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would "have a leg to stand on" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump\'s comments during last week\'s trade visit that the NHS would be "on the table" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was "absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation." The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump\'s remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly\'s Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said "legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don\'t have a veto over trade". "Politically, I think it\'s extremely unlikely to happen," the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. "They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power." Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or \'concordat\' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: "I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. "The argument we\'ll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it\'s not the reality of intergovernmental relations." "The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. "At the moment, your answers aren\'t giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government\'s argument is, \'we\'ll see you in court\', it\'s not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together," he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: "Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? "Absolutely not... and it\'s not just in relation to trade, it\'s in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built."', 'output': 'NHS Wales: Court action if trade deals affect service?', 'explanation': 'The output phrase is the appropriate title for the given text and it highlights the essence of the passage.'}, {'input': 'By Jon Welch and Paul MoseleyBBC News Details of health problems, family bereavements and personal issues were sent by the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich to 298 students. Megan Baynes, 23, said she felt "sick and horrified" when she realised her details had been shared. The UEA apologised "unreservedly" and said an inquiry had begun. The email contained a spreadsheet listing 172 names and details extenuating circumstances in which extensions and other academic concessions were granted to 42 students. \'Felt sick\' It was sent to nearly 300 undergraduates, including Ms Baynes, a former editor of student newspaper Concrete. She is currently awaiting the results of her American Literature and Creative Writing degree, and had been granted extensions for coursework because of an illness suffered by a family member. "I felt sick at seeing my personal situation written in a spreadsheet, and then seemingly sent to everyone on my course," she said. "My situation was not the worst on there but there are some on there that are so personal. There are people I know and I feel so awful for them and can\'t imagine how they are feeling." Theo Antoniou Phillips, UEA Students\' Union undergraduate education officer, said: "This is a shocking and utterly unacceptable data breach that should never have happened." Jo Swo, the union\'s welfare, community and diversity officer, said: "Given the university is supposed to be making mental health a priority, this is a real slap in the face to students who have sought support." In a statement, a UEA spokeswoman said: "An email was mistakenly sent to 298 American Studies undergraduates this morning containing details of 42 students with extenuating circumstances. "This clearly should not have happened and the university apologises unreservedly. The university has launched an urgent enquiry and is contacting all affected students to offer support.

Vernigora was also a professional chess player and was studying at Moscow State University. The Ukrainian sports website sport.ua says Bogdanovich was a grandmaster from Odessa who won the Ukrainian Under-18 championship and various chess awards at international tournaments. Russian chess website chess-news.ru says that in 2015 he was rated eighth in the world for speed (blitz) chess. Reports say Bogdanovich drew much criticism recently for representing Russia in an internet chess match against Ukraine, which he won. Sport.ua quotes a Facebook post from him (in Russian) about that, in which he argued that playing for Russia was good for business, that he was living as a guest in Russia and being treated well, and this was his small contribution to ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Nitrous oxide was first used as an anaesthetic in 1844, but is now being used as a recreational drug and has been linked to a number of deaths.

The result has been described as a "superb lift" for the spa town. Work to rip up the club\'s artificial pitch and replace it with grass, in keeping with league regulations, is expected to start later on Monday. Fan Brody Pattison joked that he wanted some of the artificial pitch in his back garden as a souvenir. He said: "I can\'t thank the players enough, they\'re all heroes for this town, they\'re going to go down in history. "We\'ve come so far as a club in the last three or four years, we\'re a small town full of teashops and we\'re in the Football League." Another Sulphurites supporter, Jack Wilkinson, said he woke up on Monday with a bottle of champagne and a huge sign saying "we\'re going to Wembley". He said: "As soon as they scored the first goal, that\'s when the tears started and they didn\'t stop until full-time, I\'m a grown adult crying over a football match. "It makes the early mornings going to Dover, Yeovil, Torquay all worth it." The Sulphurites also won the praise of what is possibly Harrogate\'s most famous institution, Bettys tearoom. A spokeswoman said: "We\'ve the kettle on and Fat Rascals (a kind of scone) in the oven. We\'re delighted to raise a toast to Simon Weaver and the winning Harrogate team." Harrogate businessman Mark Noble was lucky enough to attend the game as a guest of the club. He said: "The lads were all so proud, the support they\'ve had all season was with them yesterday, the flags were up. "Yesterday was a large key opening a large door, next season we\'re in that room and hopefully when Covid is over, all the supporters will all be there following the team." Simon Cotton, who runs hotels and pubs in and around the town, said promotion was a "superb lift" for Harrogate after "so many months of lockdown blues". He said: "Harrogate relies on visitor tourism and if more fans are travelling to see their teams then they\'re potentially going to stay in hotels in the town, go for a drink in the bars, have something to eat in the restaurants and buy something in the shops." There have been calls for an open-top bus parade, although coronavirus restrictions mean this is unlikely. Harrogate Borough mayor Stuart Martin said: "We\'ve got to try and think of how best we can celebrate - under normal circumstances, wouldn\'t it have been nice to have a civic reception for them? - but there\'s no way we can do that under the current climate, it\'s just not feasible." He said promotion was "going to bring a real buzz to the town, to the district, to the county" and would encourage more youngsters to get involved in sport. Lindsey Whitton, captain of Harrogate Town\'s women\'s team, said she hoped the club\'s recent success would inspire more girls to start playing football. She said: "It\'s amazing, the profile of the club has just risen so much within 24 hours, not only for the men\'s team but it\'s going to have a massive impact on the women\'s team, the player development centre, the academy."

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it had decided against pressing manslaughter charges against any people or the club. Ms Burt, from Hampshire, was in her first year reading natural sciences at Durham University. The CPS said it had also reviewed its decision not to prosecute and upheld its original view. \'Deeply disappointed\' It considered charges of manslaughter by gross negligence against the individual suspects and charges of corporate manslaughter against the business. Ms Burt\'s parents Nigel and Paula Burt said: "Clearly we are deeply disappointed that after such a lengthy investigation, lasting more than two-and-a-half years, this decision has been reached. "We hope that there will now be a thorough and independent investigation into whether any health and safety offences have been committed." The CPS said it had considered the evidence provided by the police and judged the legal test for bringing a prosecution had not been met. A spokesman said: "We understand how difficult this will be for Olivia\'s family and have provided them with a detailed explanation of the decision." Ms Burt, who was a member of the British sailing team, grew up in Milford-on-Sea and had been head girl of Bournemouth School for Girls.

The authority is seeking the compensation from the developers and backers Lancashire County Council about the planned 65-hectare retail park. They said the "money is not justified". The developers said the site features restaurants and a hotel and would also create 4,500 jobs and could house offices and shops, as well as the Ikea store. But Chorley Council is concerned the plans could drive people away from its own new-look town centre, which will feature a cinema and new high street shops. The planning application will be dealt with by South Ribble Borough Council next month. Chorley Council has written a letter spelling out concerns, including fears about the impact of increased traffic. The council\'s deputy leader Peter Wilson said the council had been watching the plans "very closely" and wanted to "protect the interests" of Chorley. He added: "While we want to see economic growth across Lancashire, we are concerned that the proposals don\'t properly address the impact that a development of that size could have on Chorley town centre and the traffic and highways surrounding the area. "For those reasons, we cannot support the proposals as they currently stand." The council\'s objection letter demands "a financial contribution of Â£11,520,121.00 to mitigate the impact of the Cuerden development". A spokesman for the Cuerden Strategic Site developers said: "We are aware that Chorley Council has objected to the Cuerden application, however it is unclear from their letter what the justification is for doing so. "Following a detailed and robust assessment, our own professional advisers have concluded that the potential retail impacts on neighbouring areas are acceptable.

Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action "sounds like the last breath before you\'re thrown out of the pub". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would "have a leg to stand on" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump\'s comments during last week\'s trade visit that the NHS would be "on the table" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was "absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation." The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump\'s remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly\'s Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said "legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don\'t have a veto over trade". "Politically, I think it\'s extremely unlikely to happen," the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. "They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power." Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or \'concordat\' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: "I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. "The argument we\'ll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it\'s not the reality of intergovernmental relations." "The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. "At the moment, your answers aren\'t giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government\'s argument is, \'we\'ll see you in court\', it\'s not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together," he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: "Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? "Absolutely not... and it\'s not just in relation to trade, it\'s in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built."\n Output: NHS Wales: Court action if trade deals affect service?\n\nNow complete the following example -\nInput: Chorley Council has objected to plans for the Cuerden retail park near Bamber Bridge in Lancashire amid concerns it could threaten its Â£17m town centre redevelopment. The authority is seeking the compensation from the developers and backers Lancashire County Council about the planned 65-hectare retail park. They said the "money is not justified". The developers said the site features restaurants and a hotel and would also create 4,500 jobs and could house offices and shops, as well as the Ikea store. But Chorley Council is concerned the plans could drive people away from its own new-look town centre, which will feature a cinema and new high street shops. The planning application will be dealt with by South Ribble Borough Council next month. Chorley Council has written a letter spelling out concerns, including fears about the impact of increased traffic. The council\'s deputy leader Peter Wilson said the council had been watching the plans "very closely" and wanted to "protect the interests" of Chorley. He added: "While we want to see economic growth across Lancashire, we are concerned that the proposals don\'t properly address the impact that a development of that size could have on Chorley town centre and the traffic and highways surrounding the area. "For those reasons, we cannot support the proposals as they currently stand." The council\'s objection letter demands "a financial contribution of Â£11,520,121.00 to mitigate the impact of the Cuerden development". A spokesman for the Cuerden Strategic Site developers said: "We are aware that Chorley Council has objected to the Cuerden application, however it is unclear from their letter what the justification is for doing so. "Following a detailed and robust assessment, our own professional advisers have concluded that the potential retail impacts on neighbouring areas are acceptable. "Therefore, Chorley Council\'s request for a significant sum of money by way of mitigation is not justified."\nOutput:  Â£'}
